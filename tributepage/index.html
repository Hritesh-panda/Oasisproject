              Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in
              astrophysics and won the National Olympiad in Physics. He secured
              admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later renamed Delhi
              Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering
              degree in mechanical engineering.

              Sushant Singh Rajput - the man who won billions of hearts with his
              honest performances could have been the king of Bollywood. Sumita
              Chakraborty remembers the fabulously talented Sushant Singh Rajput
              and traces his journey into the acting world. He had it all –
              goodw looks, charisma and loads of talent. Said to be one of the
              most intelligent actors in the film industry, Sushant Singh Rajput
              was not just an actor, he was also a philosopher, an astronomy
              enthusiasts and a science buff, besides so many other things.
              Perhaps that’s why it’s more shocking today that this superstar
              who could have ruled Bollywood is no more and it’s been exactly a
              year that we are left with nothing but his memories.
